# Task Manager API

## Overview

The Task Manager API is a solution for managing tasks using Node.js and the csv-parser library. It simplifies the process of task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion while also providing the ability to import tasks from CSV files.

## Features

- **Create Task (POST /tasks):** Create new tasks by sending `title` and `description` in the request body. The `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `completed_at` fields are automatically generated.

- **List Tasks (GET /tasks):** Retrieve a list of all tasks or perform searches based on `title` and `description`.

- **Update Task (PUT /tasks/:id):** Update task details by `id`. Send `title` and/or `description` in the request body.

- **Delete Task (DELETE /tasks/:id):** Delete tasks by `id`.

- **Complete Task (PATCH /tasks/:id/complete):** Mark tasks as complete or not complete.

- **CSV Import:** Import tasks from CSV files asynchronously using the csv-parser library.
